Network and Content Setup: The code initializes a network with a defined number of nodes and unique content items. Each content item has randomly assigned popularity and priority scores, and each node has a unique demand matrix for these contents. This setup simulates a real-world scenario where nodes request content with varying priorities.

Demand and Delivery Cost Calculation: Based on content popularity, priority, and node-specific demand, a weighted content demand score is calculated. A random delivery cost matrix simulates the cost of delivering content between network nodes, allowing us to compute total delivery costs based on cache placement decisions.

DQN (Deep Q-Network) Initialization: A neural network (DQN) is used instead of a simple Q-table due to the complex state-action space. The DQN approximates Q-values for each action (caching decisions) given the current state (content demand). A policy network learns the caching strategy, while a target network provides stable Q-values for training.

Exploration and Exploitation Strategy: The implementation follows an epsilon-greedy policy, balancing exploration (random caching choices) and exploitation (selecting the best action based on Q-values). Epsilon decreases over episodes, gradually shifting the agent from exploration to focused exploitation as it learns an optimal policy.

Cache Placement Decision Process: In each episode, each node decides on content to cache based on the Q-values. If the node’s cache is not full, the selected content is added. Each caching decision is based either on exploration (randomly chosen content) or exploitation (content with the highest Q-value).

Reward Calculation: After each caching decision, the code calculates the immediate reward by computing the negative delivery cost based on the current cache placement. Lower delivery costs lead to higher rewards, guiding the agent toward more efficient cache placements over time.

Experience Replay: A memory buffer stores past experiences (state, action, reward, next state). Once sufficient data is collected, the code randomly samples mini-batches from this memory to train the policy network. Experience replay helps the agent learn stable policies by breaking correlations in the training data.

Q-Network Update: After each decision and reward calculation, the agent updates the Q-values using the policy network and the target network. The target network is only updated periodically (every 10 episodes) to provide more stable Q-value targets, improving training stability and convergence.

Optimal Cache Placement and Evaluation: After training, the agent determines an optimal cache placement for each node by selecting the top cache_capacity content items based on Q-values. This final cache placement is then used to calculate the optimized delivery cost.

Visualization and Analysis: The code tracks key metrics, including delivery costs and epsilon decay over episodes, and visualizes them through plots. These visualizations provide insights into the agent’s performance improvements, exploration-exploitation balance, and the distribution of optimal content placements across nodes.
